How to use:

Our example: 
To look for: “test123
Responds: “/hellothere”, “/howareyou”

1st Set command #1 to /hellothere
/bs command 1 hellothere

2nd Set command #2 to /howareyou 
/bs command 2 howareyou

2rd, set the message it is going to look for:
/bs create test123

Now, send a message from ANY account on the same server or to the bot, and it will run those commands in-game!
