A ChatTriggers Module that allows users to create automatic bot systems, extremely easily, using commands! With custom chat criteria you can make any message responded with commands!

Good example: Using /copy and /paste to reset maps!

To view A example open "help.md"

How it works:
Sent message (via player or command): ABC
Response: /copy | /paste | /resetmapmsg!

Any Malicious or unintended use of this script Is not my fault and is the users.

Enjoy! -glso
If you have any questions Let me know via DM or in game! (IGN: glso)

Note: Make sure you set the Commands before creating criteria!
